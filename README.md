## generating code
```
```

## running the application
To run the application run the POETS orchestrator after connecting to a POETS box through `./orchestrate.sh` and run the following commands:

```
load /app = +"gol.xml"
tlink /app = *
place /tfill = *
compose /app = *
deploy /app = *
initialize /app = *
run /app = *
```

Alternatively, you can write all these commands to a text file and run the program through `./orchestrate -b path/of/file`
